#### Video Demo:  <(https://youtu.be/V0Oj0YUhrVo)>
#### Description: A game of Tic Tac Toe made with python

### Features:
- **Interactive 3x3 Grid**: Players alternate turns to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the board.
- **Winning Conditions**: The game checks for wins across rows, columns, or diagonals after every move.
- **Draw Detection**: If all tiles are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
- **Restart Functionality**: Players can restart the game at any time with the "RESTART" button.

### How It Works:
1. **Game Start**: The game begins with Player X's turn.
2. **Turn-Based Play**: Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their marks.
3. **Automatic Win/Draw Detection**: The program checks for a winner or a draw after every move.
4. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Winning tiles are highlighted in red.
   - A message at the top indicates the game's result or whose turn it is.
5. **Reset Game**: Click the "RESTART" button to clear the board and start over.
